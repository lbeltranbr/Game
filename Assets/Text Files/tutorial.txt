Hey there! Don't be afraid I'm here to help guide you!

Guide me? To what?

I'm here to help guide your soul, to help you be at peace.

Oh, so this isn't a dream, I don't remember what happened.

Don’t worry! on your path to peace your memories will come back to you.

Before I let you go, I should show you how to navigate these parts.

Use “A” and “D” keys to move around.
