Girl
H-hello? Where am I? is anyone here!
Spirit
Hey there! Don’t be afraid I’m here to help guide you!
Girl
Guide me? To what?
Spirit
I’m here to help guide your soul, to help you be at peace.
Girl
Oh, so this isn’t a dream, I don’t remember what happened.
Spirit
Don’t worry! on your path to peace your memories will come back to you.
Spirit
Before I let you go, I should show you how to navigate these parts.
Spirit
Use “A” and “D” keys to move around
Spirit 
Yeah! You’re getting the hang of it!
Spirit
Sadly, all spirits aren’t as friendly and cute as me, so try your best to avoid them!
Spirit 
If you do encounter any spirits and wish to speak with them press the “E” key.
Spirit
Give it a try on me!
Spirit
There you go, see isn’t that easy!
Spirit
Now that you understand the basics, I’ll leave you for now, but don’t worry I’ll come back when I’m needed.
Spirit
Just keep walking a bit further and you’ll come across a cave, this is where you will get your first memory! Goodluck!
