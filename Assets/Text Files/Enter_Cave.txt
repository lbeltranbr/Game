Spirit
W-wait, before you enter!
Girl
Hi, can I help you?
Spirit
Yes! But allow me to help you first with a few warnings!
Girl
Oh, thank you!
Spirit
This cave used to be my home, but the evil spirits of the forest took over and knocked my spirit orbs out of place allowing them to inhabit it!
Spirit
I need you to put the spirit orbs back into their lanterns for me.
Spirit
If you do this, the spirits may be grateful and offer you a memory core!
Spirit 
The evil spirits, however, will try to stop you, stay within the light of the spirit orbs and you will be safe! If you move beyond the light, they will grab you into the shadows!
Spirit
Be weary of any cracks in the ground along the way, the evil spirits opened these up to capture us!
Girl
Thank you! I will try my best to help you and get rid of the evil spirits that dwell within the  cave!
