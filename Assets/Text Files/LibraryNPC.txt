What is a little girl doing in my library?
Girl
Iâ€™m lost and trying to find my way home.
Spirit
Home? There is no such place as home here.
Girl
What do you mean?
Spirit
This is the underworld young one, you may either leave by being at peace or stay here in the shadows in constant regret and despair.
Girl
Can your library help me?
Spirit
That depends on what you need help with.
Spirit
You seem to be lost in more than one way, your memories seem to be missing.
Spirit
If you can answer my riddle I can restore a memory for you, if you fail to answer correctly your soul belongs to me.
Girl
It would help a lot, I accept!
Spirit
The riddle is as follows; The person who built it sold it. The person who bought it never used it. The person who used it never saw it. What is it?
Spirit
The answer can be found in my library of books!
