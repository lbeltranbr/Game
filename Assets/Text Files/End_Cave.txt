Spirit
Thank you for clearing out the evil spirits and returning my home to me!
Girl
You’re welcome I’m glad I could help!
Girl
Sorry I misjudged you, I was told to be weary of other spirits.
Spirit
One more thing before you go, you should be weary from here on, the upcoming forest houses evil spirits, even the friendliest of spirits can be evil.
Spirit
You can rest assured that I am no evil spirit, however you should be weary from here on, the upcoming forest houses evil spirits, even the friendliest of spirits can be evil.
Girl
I’ll keep that in mind, goodbye!
